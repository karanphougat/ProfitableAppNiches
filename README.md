# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

# About

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.

Considering that we only build apps that are free to download and install, app language is english, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads, our revenue for any given app will be influenced by the number of users that use our app.

As a data analyst, my job will be enable my team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

# Goals

- Clean app stores' sample dataset.
- Analyze Apple and Google store data.
- Find Profitable App Niches on Apple App Store and Google Play Markets.

# Datasets

Collecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:

- A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).
- A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).

# Conclusion and Ideas

In this project, we analyzed data about the Apple App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.

We concluded that `Business`, `Sports`, and `Book` niches are good options to build an app for.

Infact, I have a few ideas as well:

- We can convert learnings from different books and make an app where the users can read their summary, listen to major points of the books, download famous quotes from books as wallpapers or social media post and share excerpts with their friends through online chats or SMS along with the app link. Infact, we can make it fun and reward users with different rewards when they sign up, complete a book or share the book.

- Reference guides are evergreen. We can create an app which will work as reference guides for different niches such as Software Development, Personal Finance or even Food. We will need to make them interesting, interactive and provide with some extra features such as knowledge sharing in pictures with friends.

- Smart business tools can help us help businesses to either save money or earn more revenue. Businesses really appreciate that. Project management apps, business guides, Invoicing apps, etc. are practical apps, with great prospects and less competition.

- Sports information apps such as live match scores with text/audio commentary, player/team information, match schedules, and points table can be really powerful and engaging. Besides having high usage time, they are informative and practical and hence a good genre to be making an app in.
